During the 2003–04 English football season, Portsmouth F.C. 
competed in the Premier League . It was their first ever
season in the Premiership and the first in English football's top flight since
the 1987–88  season.






SEASON SUMMARY



Portsmouth's Premiership debut (and only their second top division campaign
during the last 45 years) was a fine one, as they finished 13th and established
Fratton Park  as one of the hardest Premiership grounds to get a
result at. Only their dismal away form (with only two away wins all season)
prevented them from finishing even higher and challenging for a European place,
but it was still a very good season for the only newly promoted side to preserve
their Premiership status.

After a good start to the season which saw Portsmouth top of the Premiership
after three games, the team slumped into the relegation zone, but rallied and
only lost one of their last ten matches to finish 13th – ahead of more
established sides like Everton, Manchester City, Blackburn Rovers and Tottenham
Hotspur. To their credit, they were one of the only two teams to remain unbeaten
against Arsenal's "Invincibles" in the league during the season.
