Soldadu  Muhammad Suhandi bin Haji Awang Mahali (born 4 May
1985) is a Bruneian  footballer  who last
played for MS ABDB  of the Brunei Super League
 as a goalkeeper
.  He is a
five-time Brunei FA Cup  winner and a member of ABDB's
championship squad on two occasions. 




CLUB CAREER



Suhandi was part of the QAF FC  squad in 2004.
 He started playing for the football team of his
employers the Brunei army  in 2008.
 He won the majority of his FA Cup medals in
his early years while competing the goalkeeper spot with Tarmizi Johari
,  but they were luckless in
the league that was dominated by QAF FC  and later Indera SC
. 

On 1 February 2013, Suhandi scored a penalty in the 82nd minute in the 2012–13
Brunei Super League  game against Najip FC which
finished 11–1 to MS ABDB.  This made Suhandi
the third goalkeeper to score a goal in a league fixture in Brunei, after
Fakhrul Zulhazmi Yussof  and Mu'izzuddin Ismail
.

MS ABDB started the 2014 Brunei Super League  with a
3–2 loss to LLRC FT on 2 February.  Days later
Tarmizi Johari, who had started the game, signed a professional contract with
DPMM FC , enabling Suhandi to become the starting goalkeeper for the
Armymen.  In his third league match, he let in
a free kick by Syarafuddin Hamdi Talip  slip between
his legs in a 0–1 reverse at the hands of MS PDB .
 These two defeats along with another loss to
eventual champions Indera SC  a month later would cost ABDB the
title with Suhandi only keeping five clean sheets in 15 appearances.
 (Another clean sheet was attributed to Zulfadhli
Matassan as Suhandi served a suspension for a red card against Majra FC.
)

At the start of the 2015 season  Suhandi found himself
replacing Tarmizi as the third-choice keeper behind Wardun Yussof
 and Azman Ilham Noor  in the DPMM
ranks.  This turned into an uneventful
stint for Suhandi, failing to make a single appearance even on the bench, while
back at ABDB Tarmizi managed to finally win the league with only four points
dropped in the 2015 Brunei Super League .
 Suhandi was released from DPMM in early 2016
along with Amalul Said . 

Suhandi returned to the MS ABDB ranks in late 2016, but by that time there were
already three keepers in the squad along with the signing of former youth
international Burhanuddin Edy Asmady earlier in the year.
 Nevertheless, he managed to appear in four
matches for the 2017–18 season  (another
title-winning season for MS ABDB) before being deregistered soon after.



INTERNATIONAL CAREER



Suhandi made his international debut for the Brunei national team as a
substitute on 26 September 2012 against Indonesia national football team
 in a 5–0 loss, playing the last 15 minutes
of the game.  He was listed by the Wasps for
the 2012 AFF Championship qualification 
matches in the following month, but did not make the cut.
