London was launched in 1832 by Wigrams for Money and H. L. Wigram to carry
passengers to India. From 1840 she made two voyages from England 
carrying immigrants to New Zealand  for the New Zealand Company
. She also made two voyages transporting
 convicts  from the United Kingdom to
Tasmania . She then became a transport for several years before
returning to trading between Newcastle and Spain. She ran into a barque
 in 1866 with the result that the barque's crew had to abandon their
vessel. London was last listed in 1869.






CAREER



London first appeared in Lloyd's Register  (LR) in 1832.




On 4 June 1832 London, Captain John Wimble, was due to sail to Madras
 and Calcutta . London sailed on 19 June, left Madras on
25 September, and arrived at Calcutta on 3 October. On this voyage London
carried 300 tons of coal that she had loaded in London. While she was at
Calcutta a portion of this cargo ignited spontaneously; the burning cargo was
removed. London sustained some damage.
 This was the first of several
voyages to Calcutta and return that London and Wimble made.

1st immigrant voyage to New Zealand (1840): London sailed under Captain Henry
Shuttleworth for Wellington, leaving the Downs  on
19 August 1840 and arriving at Wellington on 12 December. She arrived with 193
immigrants and 43 cabin passengers. She had left with some 228 immigrants and
passengers. She sailed to Calcutta, and left there for London on 27 May 1841.
She reached the Cape of Good Hope  on 3 August and arrived
back in London on 11 October. 

2nd immigrant voyage to New Zealand (1842): London, Captain Joseph Thomas
Attwood, master, left Gravesend in January 1842. She arrived in Wellington on 1
May 1842 with 182 immigrants. 

1st convict voyage (1844): On 23 March 1844 London, under Captain John T.
Attwood, brought 250 male convicts from Plymouth to Tasmania, arriving on 9
July.  She
suffered no convict deaths on the voyage.




In 1847 London was sold for £5,900 to Teighe & Co. The owners were Thomas
Dominick James Teighe (32/64), Charles Teighe (8/64), Robert Dyet (8/64),
William Dix (8/64), and Frederick Leachey (8/64).
 LR did not catch up with the change
of ownership and a change in destination until the 1851 issue.

2nd convict voyage (1850–1851): Captain J. Sceales sailed from Dublin 
on 20 December 1850. London arrived in Hobart on 10 March 1851.
 she had embarked
288 male convicts and suffered three convict deaths on the voyage.




New owners in 1858–1859 transferred London's registry to Newcastle.




In late 1866 London, Ramsey, master, of Newcastle, was sailing to Newcastle from
Cartagena, Spain , when she ran into Palmen, Hendrickson,
master. Palman's crew abandoned Palman in a sinking state. On 14 December the
Norwegian barque Nanna, Hansen, master, rescued Captain Hendrickson and eight
crewmembers at 40°N 12°W
.
