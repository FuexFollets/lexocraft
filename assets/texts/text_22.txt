ECONOMY



Panem Coal, a joint venture of Punjab State Power Corporation
 and Eastern Minerals and Trading Agency
(EMTA), operates the Pachhwara Central project. It is estimated that Pachhwara
Central block has reserves of 562 million tonnes of coal. It is a part of the
Rajmahal coalfield . An open cast mine 
has been developed across 11 square kilometres (4.2 sq mi). It supplies coal to
three power pants in Punjab. Jharkhand state government earns a royalty of
around Rs. 100 crores annually. The operations have displaced 250 families. The
project began in 2002 and ran into trouble when the Santhal community inhabiting
the area were pushed off their land. Sister Valsa John, an Indian nun, organised
the Santhals to demand compensation for their land for the project. Ultimately
Panem Coal was forced into a compensation agreement. However, Sister Valsa was
beaten and hacked to death by a mob in 2011.
