In eight-dimensional geometry , a truncated 8-orthoplex is a convex
uniform 8-polytope , being a truncation
 of the regular 8-orthoplex .



There are 7 truncation for the 8-orthoplex. Vertices of the truncation
8-orthoplex are located as pairs on the edge of the 8-orthoplex. Vertices of the
bitruncated 8-orthoplex are located on the triangular faces of the 8-orthoplex.
Vertices of the tritruncated 7-orthoplex are located inside the tetrahedral
 cells of the 8-orthoplex. The final truncations are best
expressed relative to the 8-cube.

CONSTRUCTION

There are two Coxeter groups  associated with the truncated
8-orthoplex, one with the C8 or  Coxeter group, and a lower
symmetry with the D8 or  Coxeter group.
