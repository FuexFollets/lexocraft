Francis E. Rodgers (November 15, 1909 â€“ February 8, 2000) was an American
Democratic Party  politician who was among
the longest-serving mayors  in U.S. history, first elected in 1946 as
Mayor of Harrison, New Jersey . He served in the
position for 48 years from 1946 to 1995, having been elected to 24 consecutive
two-year terms in office.  On May 30,
1987, Rodgers earned a place in the Guinness Book of World Records
 when he surpassed Mayor Erastus Corning II
 of Albany, New York , who died in
office in 1983 after having served 40 years, 4 months and 28 days in office. The
town marked the occasion by closing municipal offices in the mayor's honor and
by letting students in the Harrison Public Schools 
have a day off.  However, Mayor Hilmar Moore
 of Richmond, Texas, served a much longer span of 63 years in
office until he died in 2012. 




BIOGRAPHY



He was born in Harrison on November 15, 1909, to Michael Rodgers and Johanna
Davin, and attended St. Benedict's Preparatory School
 in Newark .
 Rodgers ran for the Harrison Town Council for
the first time in 1935, and served there for ten years, including a term when he
was re-elected to the office while serving 27 months in the United States Army
 during World War II  in the
Counterintelligence Corps .


Rodgers defeated incumbent Frederick J. Gassert in his first bid for the
mayoralty, a candidate backed by Jersey City  Mayor
Frank Hague 's Hudson County 
Democratic Party machine. Over his years in office, Rodgers had served as Town
Clerk, as County Clerk, as a member of the Hudson County Board of Chosen
Freeholders  and as the Board's
clerk. He served two terms in the New Jersey Senate , from
1978 to 1984, defeating Independent incumbent Anthony Imperiale
. 

Rodgers served on numerous state authorities and commissions, including being
appointed secretary of the New Jersey Racing Commission by Governor
 Richard J. Hughes  in 1963, to
the New Jersey Highway Authority  in 1976 by Governor
Brendan Byrne , and to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority
 by Republican Governor Thomas Kean  in
1984. 

Rodgers won his final election campaign in November 1992 by a narrow 111 vote
margin out of 3,600 votes cast, in this heavily-Democratic community, having
been unable to campaign due to a chronic knee injury.
 Rodgers cited the injury and his desire to
allow a younger generation to serve in office as his justification for declining
to run for a 25th term in office. He was succeeded by Raymond J. McDonough.
 He maintained his position as chairman of the
Harrison Democratic Committee after leaving office in 1995.


Rodgers was inducted into the Mayors' Hall of Fame in 1995 by the New Jersey
State League of Municipalities ,
having been the prime proponent for the creation of the hall during his tenure
with the organization. 

Rodgers died on February 8, 2000, and was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery
 in North Arlington, New Jersey
.
