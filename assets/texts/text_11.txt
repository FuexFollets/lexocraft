HISTORY


Dummerston in 1913

According to the book 1491 by Charles Mann, Dummerston was stolen from Native
Americans by Europeans.

Dummerston was part of the Equivalent Lands —several large
sections of land given to settlers in the early eighteenth century. It lies on a
tract  given to the Connecticut Colony 
about 1715 by the Province of Massachusetts Bay
 as compensation for land mistakenly awarded by
the latter to its settlers. In 1716, the town was auctioned to a consortium
 (which included William Dummer , lieutenant
governor of Massachusetts), and named Dummerston. On December 26, 1753, the town
was chartered as a New Hampshire grant  and renamed
Fulham  by Governor Benning Wentworth . But when
the grant was renegotiated, it reverted to Dummerston.


The many brooks and streams flowing into the West River 
provided the area with water power. Dummerston had five gristmills, five
sawmills, one slate manufacturer, and one shop for making rakes. Raising sheep
across the many hills was an important occupation.
 By 1859, the town had a population of 1,645.
The Vermont Valley Railroad  passed through
Dummerston. 

A house built in Dummerston in 1892, Naulakha , was home to
author Rudyard Kipling . This is where he wrote several of
his novels, including The Jungle Books  and Captains
Courageous . 

There was a covered bridge that was built in 1812, and it moved to Old
Sturbridge Village  in 1946.
