 Donatus is mentioned in Frankish  annals from 805 as an ambassador of the Dalmatian cities to Charlemagne  in Thionville . Donatus is credited for initiating either construction or expansion of the Church of the Holy Trinity. The church was completed in the beginning of the 9th century and in the 15th century. Its name was later changed by the Venetians to the Church of St. Donatus .


 DONATUS'S CHURCH


 The church is the largest Pre-Romanesque building in Croatia, and was built upon the ruin of the old Roman forum,  part of the forum's foundations can be seen today.
 The marble sarcophagus  in the cathedral preserves the relics of the Sirmian  martyr St. Anastasia  with an inscription dating from Donatus' time. According to tradition, St. Donatus brought the relics to Zara from Constantinople, when he was there with the Venetian  duke Beato. They had been ordered by Charlemagne to negotiate the border  between the Byzantine Empire  and the Croatian  territories that were under the dominion of Charlemagne's Frankish Empire .
 Donatus died around 811, and was buried in his Church of the Holy Trinity (today the Church of St. Donatus). After 1809, following the French occupation of Zadar, his bones were transferred to the Cathedral of St. Anastasia  where they lie to this date, and mass has not been celebrated at the church for around two centuries.
