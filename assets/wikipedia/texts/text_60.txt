 HISTORY


 The Hoofers Club was a legendary site of some of the best of jazz  and tap performers, particularly in the 1920s and 1930s. It was located on Harlem's "Swing Street," the stretch of 133rd Street  between Lenox  and Seventh Avenues  known for its music and dance venues.
 The Hoofers Club was actually a small room in the back of a comedy club.

 > When you walked down the stairs of the Hoofers Club ... you would go into a > little room. The room was no bigger than 30x20 feet. It had a piano in the > corner and a good floor. All the dancers around town came in. You could hear > dancing the minute you got in the building. There was always dancin' going on, > known dancers and unknown dancers. 
 Among the tap dancers who appeared at the club were Bill Robinson ,  Jack Wiggins , Maceo Anderson ,  "Buddy" Bradley ,  John Bubbles ,  Honi Coles ,  Eddie Rector ,  Leonard Reed ,  Dewey Washington,  Raymond Winfield ,  Roland Holder ,  Hal Leroy  (one of the only White dancers ever invited in),  Harold Mablin,  "Sandman" Sims , "Slappy" Wallace,  Warren Berry, "Baby" Laurence Jackson ,  Buster Brown , and other black tap dancing greats.

The Hoofers Club comprised a more informal panel of > peers, whose judgments could be cruel and mocking and were driven by an > insistence on innovation. "Survive or die" was the credo. In an eccentric > fusion of imitation and innovation, young dancers were forced to find their > style and rhythmic voice. It was said that on the wall of the Hoofers Club was > written: "Thou shalt not copy each other's steps — Exactly." >
