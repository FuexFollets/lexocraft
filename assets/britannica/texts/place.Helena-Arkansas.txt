Helena,  city, seat (1830) of Phillips county, eastern Arkansas, U.S., port of the Mississippi River, about 50 miles (80 km) southwest of Memphis, Tennessee, and adjacent to the city of West Helena. The community, originally settled in 1797 and first called Monticello and then St. Francis, grew around a warehouse built for barge shipping. In 1811 the steamboat “New Orleans” called there, opening a prosperous era of river traffic. The county was named for Sylvanus Phillips, and the settlement was renamed (1821) for his daughter. The city was a Union supply depot during the American Civil War, and the Battle of Helena (July 4, 1863) was a futile attempt by the Confederates to capture it.

The economy, traditionally based on cotton and lumber, became increasingly industrialized after World War II, especially at West Helena (founded 1909, incorporated 1917). One of the largest harbors on an inland waterway was completed in the 1990s, making Helena a hub of industrial development. Helena is the seat of Phillips Community College of the University of Arkansas (1965). St. Francis National Forest is immediately to the north. Helena has been called the “cradle of the Delta Blues,” and each October the city’s King Biscuit Blues Festival draws fans from around the world. Inc. town, 1833; city, 1856. Pop. (2000) 6,323; (2010) 12,282.
