pickle,  cucumber that has been pickled.

The small cucumbers that are turned into pickles are from the Cucurbitaceae family—the same family as pumpkins, gourds, and watermelons—and represent possibly one of the oldest pickled foods on Earth. Eaten around the world, they are very popular in the United States and are considered a delicacy in much of northern and eastern Europe. Pickles are also enjoyed in parts of the Middle East.

In the colder climes of northern Europe, the pickling liquid tends to be a flavour-packed concoction of vinegar laced with peppercorns, mustard seeds, dill, horseradish, salt, and spices such as chili, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger. In Russia, salty pungent slices often appear as part of the traditional appetizer selection known as zakuski that is served alongside shots of vodka. In warmer climates, such as in Turkey and Lebanon, brine-cured variants are found with olives, pickled root vegetables, and pickled peppers as an appetizer. Across the Atlantic in North America, the main flavouring is typically dill, the preference is often for a sweeter milder taste, and the results are more likely to be called dill pickles.

Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, a great pickle will deliver a perky tongue-tingling balance of sweet and sour. Flavours depend on specific recipes.
