Mold,  town, historic and present county of Flintshire (Sir Fflint), northeastern Wales. It is situated on a small stretch of farmland between the two industrial centres of Deeside (region of the River Dee) and Wrexham.

Mold grew up around a motte-and-bailey castle that the Normans built in the 12th century. The native Christian Britons of the area defeated the Picts and Scots in an important battle waged in 430 ce; an obelisk, built in 1736 and located 1 mile (1.6 km) northwest of town, commemorates the victory. Mold has long been a market centre for the area. The 19th-century writer Daniel Owen, widely considered the father of the Welsh novel, was born in Mold, and the townâ€™s cultural centre contains some of his original manuscripts and personal items. Mold is the administrative centre and historic county town (seat) of Flintshire. Pop. (2001) 9,568; (2011) 10,058.
