Jimmie Johnson (born September 17, 1975, El Cajon, California, U.S.) American race-car driver who won seven National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) championships and was the first driver to win the title in five consecutive years (2006–10).

Johnson, who started competing in motor sports at age five, won his first championship in motorcycle racing at eight years old. Eventually he turned to four-wheel vehicles and took up offroad racing, competing in leagues that included Short-Course Off-Road Drivers Association, SCORE International, and Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group. He won six championships and was named Rookie of the Year in each of those leagues before moving on to the American Speed Association, where he took Rookie of the Year honours in 1998. That same year, he began to race in NASCAR’s Busch Series and by 2000 was a member of Herzog Motorsports’ Busch team, finishing third in that season’s Rookie of the Year standings. When Herzog Motorsports lost its sponsor in 2000, Johnson was recommended to Hendrick Motorsports by NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon.

On October 7, 2001, Johnson finished 39th (out of 43 drivers) in his first appearance in NASCAR’s top series, the Winston Cup Series. (The series was subsequently renamed, in 2004, the Nextel Cup Series and, in 2008, the Sprint Cup Series.) He also earned his first Busch Series win in 2001, at Chicagoland Speedway, winding up eighth in that series’s point standings. In 2002 he began his rookie season in the Cup Series, winning three races and ending the season ranked fifth. Two of those victories came at Dover International Speedway in Delaware, making him the first rookie in series history to sweep both races at a track and the first to lead the point standings (for one week). He finished second in the standings in 2003, with three victories, and did the same in 2004, when he won a series-best eight times. He finished fifth overall in 2005 before starting his dominant run the following season.

In 2006, when he won his first Cup Series championship, Johnson registered five victories, including the Daytona 500, and had 13 top-5 and 24 top-10 finishes. In 2007 he earned his second title, becoming the first driver to have 10 victories in a season (including 4 in a row) since his teammate Gordon won 13 races in 1998. In 2008 Johnson won seven races and his third championship, matching fellow American Cale Yarborough, the first driver with three consecutive championships (1976–78). In 2009 Johnson again won seven races, on his way to his fourth title. He was the first to win four straight championships, and he became the first NASCAR driver to be named Male Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press. Johnson’s six victories in 2010 helped him secure a fifth championship.

Johnson’s championship streak ended in 2011, when he finished the Cup Series season in sixth place, which he followed with a third-place finish in 2012. In February 2013 he won his second career Daytona 500 title, and he finished that NASCAR season with his sixth career Cup Series championship. Johnson had his worst full NASCAR season in 2014, finishing the year with four race wins and in 11th place in the Cup Series. He was slightly better in 2015, with five wins and a 10th-place Cup Series finish. Johnson’s streak of middling seasons was brought to a sudden end in 2016 as he won a seventh career NASCAR title, which tied him with Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt for the most championships for a driver in Cup Series history. The following year he won three NASCAR events, but those were the last of his career. After several winless seasons, Johnson retired from NASCAR in 2020. The following year he began competing in IndyCar races.
