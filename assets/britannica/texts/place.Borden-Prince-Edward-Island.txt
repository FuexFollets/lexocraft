Borden,  town, Prince county, southern Prince Edward Island, Canada, on Northumberland Strait. Named Carleton Point by the English surveyor Samuel Holland in 1765, it was renamed (1916) for Sir Robert Borden, then the Canadian prime minister. Although a fishing port, it is economically dependent upon its role as a transportation hub. Highways and a Canadian National Railway line to Charlottetown (35 miles [56 km] east) and other provincial centres radiate from the harbour, where car ferries regularly dock, connecting the island with Cape Tormentine, New Brunswick, 9 miles (14.5 km) south. From a point near Borden to Cape Tormentine the first submarine telegraph cable in North America was successfully laid (1851). Inc. 1919. Pop. (2006) 786; (2011) 750.
