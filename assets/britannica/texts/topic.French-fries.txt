french fries,  side dish or snack typically made from deep-fried potatoes that have been cut into various shapes, especially thin strips. Fries are often salted and served with other items, including ketchup, mayonnaise, or vinegar. In addition, they can be topped with more substantial fare, such as chili. Poutine is a Canadian dish of french fries covered with cheese curds and gravy.

The origin of french fries is uncertain. According to one tradition, they first appeared in France, where they were likely a snack sold by street peddlers. However, in more recent years Belgium has been cited as the birthplace. The source of the name is also disputed. One oft-repeated claim is that a U.S. soldier who tasted the dish while in the Belgian city of Namur during World War I coined the term. What is not debated is the popularity of french fries, which grew exponentially after they became a staple item at many fast-food restaurants.

French fries can be made from various varieties of potatoes, though Russets are generally preferred. In addition, sweet potatoes are sometimes used. The potatoes are cut into different shapes, such as wedges, curls, or, most commonly, thin strips. After the optional but recommended step of blanching, the pieces are dried and then typically fried in a deep fryer. The oil causes french fries to be high in fat, which is linked to cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Flavouring with salt also poses risks to the heart. Amid growing health concerns, many fast-food chains, including McDonaldâ€™s, stopped using oil that contains trans fat in the early 21st century. To avoid or limit the use of oil, french fries can also be baked in an oven or made in an air fryer.
