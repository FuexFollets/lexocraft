Meizhou,  city in northeastern Guangdong sheng (province), China. It is situated on the north bank of the Mei River, a tributary of the Han River, which discharges into the sea at Shantou. A county was established there in the late 5th century. It became the seat of a prefecture (zhou) in the early 10th century and received the name Mei in 971; the prefecture was abolished in 1368. The Qing dynasty (1644â€“1911/12), however, established a superior prefecture (fu) there under the name Jiaying. In 1912 it reverted to county status and took the name Meixian. It received its new name, Meizhou, in 1988 and became a prefecture-level city. Meizhou, sheltered by the mountains of eastern Guangdong and not easily accessible, became the destination of the Hakka, the Chinese who migrated south from North China in the early 4th and late 9th centuries. It is now one of the main centres of Hakka culture.

Meizhou is the chief collecting centre for the produce of the Mei River basin, which lies behind the coastal ranges of Guangdong. In the 1990s a rail line was completed, linking Meizhou with Guangzhou (Canton) and Shantou; its western section is part of the line between Beijing and Kowloon (Hong Kong). Another rail line extends northeast to connect Meizhou with Fujian province at Zhangping. The city has thus emerged as the major rail as well as highway junction for northeastern Guangzhou. There are also scheduled flights from Meizhou to Guangzhou. Its industries, which developed quickly in the 1990s, consist mainly of chemicals, textiles, electronics, and building materials. Pop. (2002 est.) 236,424.
