Before the Dawn,  historical novel by Shimazaki Tōson, published serially as Yoake mae in the journal Chūō koron (“Central Review”) from 1929 to 1935 and printed in book form in 1935. It details the effects of Westernization on a rural Japanese community in the second half of the 19th century. Despite its stylistic simplicity and undeveloped characterizations, it is considered a modern masterpiece for its impressive scope.

The novel traces the life of Aoyama Hanzō from 1853 to 1886. Hanzō (who was based on Shimazaki’s father) eagerly welcomes the transfer of power from the military Tokugawa shogunate to the Meiji emperor. However, his idealism gives way to disillusionment as he is alienated by the old peasants and misled by the new bureaucrats. A tragic hero, he is convinced that the cause of pure patriotism has been betrayed by the modernizers; he dies alone and insane.
