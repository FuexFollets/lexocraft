Marugame,  city, northwestern Kagawa ken (prefecture), northeastern Shikoku, Japan. It lies at the centre of an alluvial plain on the coast of the Inland Sea.

Marugame was founded as a castle town in 1597. It flourished from the Edo (Tokugawa) period (1603–1867) to the early Meiji period (1868–1912) as a sea terminal for pilgrims coming from the Kyōto and Ōsaka areas to worship at the Kompira Shrine in Kotohira, located about 10 miles (16 km) south of Marugame. The port’s importance declined with the opening of a rail line between Matsuyama and Takamatsu (stopping at Kotohira) in 1889 and with the subsequent development of bus and then air service linking Kotohira with major cities. The region around Marugame produces rice and barley under a well-organized irrigation system. The city’s industries manufacture chemicals, textiles, fans, and salt. Large coastal salt fields were reclaimed from the sea to stimulate further industrialization in the early 1980s. Pop. (2005) 110,085; (2010) 110,473.
