Gert Fröbe,  (born February 25, 1913, Zwickau, Saxony, Germany-died September 5, 1988, Munich, West Germany), German actor who epitomized the archvillain-especially for English-language audiences-after he took the role of the cruel megalomaniac Auric Goldfinger in the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger. Fröbe also appeared in many different character roles in more than 100 mostly German-language films.

Before World War II, Fröbe worked in the German theatre as a violinist, a set designer, and an actor. During the war he was a medical orderly in the Red Cross in Vienna. Fröbe returned to the stage after the war and made his film debut in Berliner Ballade (1948; also called The Berliner). Despite his versatility, as exemplified by his zany performance as a Prussian general in Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965), Fröbe’s large build and his wide identification with such parts as that of Goldfinger or a Nazi soldier increasingly limited him to roles as a "heavy."
