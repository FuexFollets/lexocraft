nucleolus,  spherical body within the nucleus of most eukaryotic cells, involved in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the formation of ribosomes. Nucleoli appear shortly after mitosis and form around specific repeating chromosome regions, known as nucleolar organizing regions, within the nucleus. A single nucleus can house one to several nucleoli, depending on the organism and cell type.

The nucleolus contains the genes that encode rRNA. Each ribosome contains ribosomal proteins, which are synthesized in the cytoplasm, and at least one large molecule of rRNA and at least one small molecule of rRNA, which are synthesized in the nucleolus. To form new ribosomes, ribosomal proteins are transported to the nucleolus and there combined with the large and small rRNA molecules, creating the large and small subunits of the ribosome. These subunits are then returned to the cytoplasm for final assembly into functional ribosomes.

In addition to its importance in ribosome biogenesis, the nucleolus contains a number of proteins with no known role in ribosome formation, which suggests that the nucleolus may have additional functions. It is possible that the nucleolus plays a role in the regulation of mitosis and the progression of the cell cycle, and it is thought to be involved with the cell’s response to stress.
