Marcel Camus (born April 21, 1912, Chappes, Ardennes, Fr.-died  Jan. 13, 1982, Paris) French motion-picture director who won international acclaim for his second film, Orfeu Negro (Black Orpheus) in 1958. The film was praised for its use of exotic settings and brilliant spectacle and won first prize at both the Cannes and Venice film festivals as well as an Oscar from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Camus, educated as an art teacher, spent most of World War II as a prisoner of war, after which he entered the film industry as an assistant and technical adviser to directors Jacques Feyder and Luis Buñuel and others.

Morte en fraude (1956; Fugitive in Saigon, 1957), Camus’s first feature film, was a protest against the war in Indochina and received little attention. Later films-such as L’Oiseau de paradis (1961; Dragon Sky, 1964), Le Chant du monde (1965; "The Song of the World"), and Otalia de Bahia (1976)-also failed to attract the interest of critics and the public in the way that Orfeu Negro had.
