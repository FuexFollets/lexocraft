Vanessa Redgrave (born January 30, 1937, London, England) British actress of stage and screen who received numerous accolades—including an Oscar, two Emmys, a Tony, and a Laurence Olivier Award—for her performances. She was also a longtime political activist, supporting the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Irish Republican Army (IRA).

Called “the greatest actress of our time” by the playwright Tennessee Williams, Redgrave came from a legendary theatrical family. Her father, Sir Michael Redgrave, was one of Britain’s most popular and respected actors, and her mother, Rachel Kempson, was a noted stage actress. Her sister, Lynn, did both stage and film work—most notably in Georgy Girl (1966) and Shine (1996)—and her brother, Corin, was a successful stage director and actor. Redgrave is also the mother of actresses Natasha and Joely Richardson from her marriage in the 1960s to director Tony Richardson.

Redgrave made her professional debut in the play A Touch of the Sun (1957), in which she costarred with her father. She appeared in her first film, Behind the Mask, in 1958 but concentrated mostly on stage work throughout the late ’50s and early ’60s and was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon during the 1959–60 season. Her film career began in earnest in 1966; within the space of two years, she appeared in four films that established her reputation as an intelligent actress with a commanding presence. The first of her six Academy Award nominations was for Morgan! (1966), her first motion picture in eight years. She then had a role in Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow-Up (1966), a psychological mystery that became a cult favourite. Redgrave’s unbilled cameo as Anne Boleyn in A Man for All Seasons (1966) and her performance as Guinevere in Camelot (1967) further secured her status as one of the most popular and respected actresses of the era.

In the late 1960s and early ’70s Redgrave showed her mastery of both classical and commercial fare. She received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of dancer Isadora Duncan in Isadora (1968), and she appeared as Nina in Sidney Lumet’s adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s The Seagull (1968). In 1971 Redgrave took on the role of Andromache in The Trojan Women and received another Oscar nomination for her work as the title character in Mary, Queen of Scots, playing opposite Glenda Jackson’s Queen Elizabeth I. Redgrave also appeared in such popular mainstream vehicles as Murder on the Orient Express (1974) and The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976), and she won an Oscar for best supporting actress for her performance as an anti-Nazi crusader in Julia (1977).

During the following two decades, Redgrave eschewed popular fare in favour of smaller films with well-written scripts or classical overtones. Her controversial performance as a Nazi concentration camp victim in the television adaptation of Arthur Miller’s Playing for Time (1980) won her an Emmy Award, though, as a longtime supporter of the Palestine Liberation Organization, she was widely criticized for accepting the role. She received her fifth Oscar nomination for her role in the film adaptation of Henry James’s The Bostonians (1984). Other notable performances included a literary agent in the film Prick Up Your Ears (1987), and for television, Lady Alice More in the remake of A Man for All Seasons (1988), Lady Torrance in Tennessee Williams’s Orpheus Descending (1990), and Blanche Hudson in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1991), a remake of the Bette Davis–Joan Crawford film, in which Redgrave costarred with her sister, Lynn. She received a sixth Oscar nomination for her work in Howards End (1992).

For many years Redgrave was nearly as well known for her outspoken and controversial political activism as she was for her acting. In addition to supporting the PLO and the Irish Republican Army, she ran unsuccessfully for the British Parliament as a candidate for the Workers’ Revolutionary Party. She produced a number of documentaries that reflect her convictions, including The Fifth War (1978), Occupied Palestine (1980), Can’t They Put Humans First (1991), which she also directed, and Wake Up, World (1993). Her political activities were not without repercussions: she was loudly booed at the 1978 Academy Awards ceremony when, during her acceptance speech, she referred to those who had objected to her nomination because of her support for Palestinian causes as “Zionist hoodlums.” Jewish organizations also protested when she was cast as Holocaust survivor Fania Fenelon in Playing for Time. There is little doubt that Redgrave’s political views affected her career, although public resentment waned in the 1990s, when she played character roles in popular films such as Mission: Impossible (1996) and Deep Impact (1998).

Thereafter Redgrave continued to work steadily. In 2003 she won a Tony Award (for best actress in a play) for her performance in Eugene O’Neill’s Long Day’s Journey into Night. Redgrave was cast in a recurring role (2004–09) on the television series Nip/Tuck and subsequently starred onstage in The Year of Magical Thinking, which was adapted from Joan Didion’s memoir of the same name, and Alfred Uhry’s Driving Miss Daisy. The two plays earned her Tony nominations in 2007 and 2011, respectively. As she entered her 70s, she appeared in the film dramas Atonement (2007), an adaptation of the novel by Ian McEwan, and Evening (2007), in which she starred as a woman who remembers a long-lost love as she lies on her deathbed.

In 2010 Redgrave had roles in the romantic comedy Letters to Juliet and the drama The Whistleblower, about the United Nations’ role in a sex-trafficking scandal in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Anonymous (2011), which advanced the theory that the plays attributed to Shakespeare were written by Edward de Vere, 17th earl of Oxford, Redgrave portrayed Elizabeth I. She then appeared as the strong-willed Volumnia in a 2011 film adaptation of Shakespeare’s Coriolanus and played a cancer victim in the uplifting Song for Marion (2012; U.S. title Unfinished Song). From 2012 she was the narrator of the BBC television series Call the Midwife. She returned to the stage as a Polish Holocaust survivor in the Off-Broadway drama The Revisionist (2013) and evinced the mother of disturbed wrestling fanatic (and multimillionaire) John du Pont in the film Foxcatcher (2014).

Redgrave also appeared in the TV movie The Go-Between (2015), an adaptation of L.P. Hartley’s novel of youthful misunderstanding (1953), and the movie Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool (2017), playing the mother of American actress Gloria Grahame. She then portrayed Juliana Bordereau, an elderly recluse living in a Venetian palazzo in The Aspern Papers (2018), a drama based on Henry James’s novelette (1888). Redgrave had previously portrayed Tina, Juliana’s skittish niece, in the 1984 revival of her father’s stage adaptation of the work (1959). In the 2018 film Redgrave’s daughter Joely assumed the role of Tina. Vanessa’s later films included Christoph Waltz’s Georgetown (2019), in which she played a wealthy woman married to a grifter, and the romantic drama Finding You (2021).

Redgrave was created Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1967, and she advanced to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2022 New Year Honours List.
