net neutrality,  principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) should not discriminate among providers of content.

With the proliferation of streaming services such as Netflix, ISPs pushed for the right to offer differently priced tiers of service to online content providers or software providers on the basis of their Internet use. Proponents of net neutrality believe, among other things, that network providers should be required to treat all broadband consumers equally instead of charging some consumers higher prices for using more bandwidth (data-carrying capacity). Opponents of net neutrality question whether cable and telephone companies could afford to invest in advanced security or transmission services if they could not charge a premium for them. In general, big Internet providers of content and software supported net neutrality, while the ISPs were against it.

In the United States the Federal Communications Commission initially issued orders in favour of net neutrality in 2010 and 2015, but, under the Donald Trump administration, those policies were reversed in 2017. As debate continues, individual states have also passed legislation concerning net neutrality.
