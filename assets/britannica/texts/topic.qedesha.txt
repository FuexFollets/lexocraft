qedesha,  in ancient societies and religions of the Middle East, a woman of special status. The exact function of the qedesha is unclear from the sources available, but it is known that the qedesha played a ritual role alongside priests and midwives. As with many classes of sacred status, the qedeshaâ€™s sexuality was at least partly regulated, but there is no reliable evidence that she engaged in prostitution as suggested by the Hebrew Bible (whence the word qedesha) and ancient Greek historians. The qedesha was typically born of high social status and could inherit and own property; her property could be passed on to her children after her death.
