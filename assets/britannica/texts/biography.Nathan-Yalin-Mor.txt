Nathan Yalin-Mor,  (born June 28, 1913, Grodno, Russia [now Hrodna, Belarus]-died February 18, 1980, Tel Aviv, Israel), Israeli journalist and political figure best known as a leader of the Stern Gang, a Zionist terrorist organization.

Yalin-Mor was one of the three leaders who succeeded Abraham Stern at the head of the Stern Gang during the period of the British mandate in Palestine. The group was responsible for attacks on British forces. Shortly before Israel achieved full independence, Yalin-Mor was arrested and charged with the murder (1948) of UN mediator Count Folke Bernadotte. Although Yalin-Mor was acquitted of murder, he was convicted of engaging in underground activities and sentenced to eight yearsâ€™ imprisonment. However, he was released from jail under an amnesty, and he served a term in the Israeli Knesset (parliament). Switching political orientation, he became a member of left-wing organizations, advocating a conciliatory line in Arab-Israeli relations. Yalin-Mor took a pro-Soviet stance on several international issues.
