Rodolfo Graziani, marquess di Neghelli (born Aug. 11, 1882, Filettino, Italy-died  Jan. 11, 1955, Rome) Italian field marshal, administrator, and adherent of Benito Mussolini.

After service in Eritrea and Libya before World War I and in Macedonia and Tripolitania subsequently, Graziani became commander in chief of Italian forces in Libya (1930–34), governor of Italian Somaliland (1935–36), viceroy of Ethiopia (1936–37), where he used poison gas against local rebels, and honorary governor of Italian East Africa (1938). Again commanding in Libya at the outbreak of World War II, he advanced against Egypt in 1940. Decisively defeated by Sir Archibald (later Earl) Wavell (December 1940–February 1941), he resigned his post. After the Italian armistice of 1943, Graziani became defense minister of Mussolini’s German-backed Italian republic, engaging in antipartisan warfare. Placed on trial after the war, he was sentenced to 19 years’ imprisonment in 1950 but was released the same year, later becoming leader of the Italian neofascist movement.
