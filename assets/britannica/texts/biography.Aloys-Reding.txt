Aloys Reding (born 1765-died  1818, Schwyz, Switz.) Swiss politician and military hero who was for a time (1801–02) head of state of the short-lived Helvetic Republic.

After some years in the armies of Spain, Reding returned to Switzerland, where he joined the native struggle against the invading French. On May 2–3, 1798, he led the stubborn Swiss defense at Schindellegi and Rotenturm but was ultimately forced to capitulate. In the politics of the new French satellite state-the Helvetic Republic-he sided with the partisans of the old federalism and steadily opposed French influence. Only a reluctant participant in politics, Reding was nonetheless elected Landammann (chief executive) of the republic after the coup in October 1801. As Landammann, he pressed for federalist constitutional revision, but in this effort he met the resistance of the controlling Napoleonic veto. Replaced by another coup (April 17, 1802), he was named to head a rival insurrectionary government (August–September 1802) but was subsequently imprisoned upon the restoration of order by French troops. Later, under the government of Napoleon’s new Swiss Confederation, Reding generally confined himself to the cantonal politics of Schwyz.
