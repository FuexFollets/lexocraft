Only the 12th-century nave and the belfry remain of its ancient cathedral of Saint-Martin, part of which collapsed in 1796. The town is the site of a national firearms factory.

Tulle is the administrative seat of the département as well as a centre of tourism and commerce. Pop. (1999) 15,553; (2014 est.) 14,325.
