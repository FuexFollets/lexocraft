protogalaxy,   in cosmology, vast cloud of gas that by contraction and condensation becomes a galaxy of stars. In evolutionary ("big-bang") models of creation, protogalaxies appear early in the expansion phase of the universe; in the steady-state model they are slowly but continually forming from newly created matter.
