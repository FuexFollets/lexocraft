Emilio Castelar y Ripoll (born September 7, 1832, Cádiz, Spain-died May 25, 1899, San Pedro del Pinatar) statesman and author, one of the most powerful champions of Spanish republicanism in the latter half of the 19th century. He was president of the first Spanish Republic from September 1873 to January 1874.

Castelar studied at the University of Madrid, where he became professor of history and was active in politics. He achieved fame as an orator and notoriety for his speeches against the monarchy; this latter activity lost him his chair in April 1865. After the abortive republican uprising of 1866, he was sentenced to death but escaped to France. After the successful revolution of 1868, he returned and entered the Cortes (parliament) as an energetic and effective defender of republican ideals. As a minister of state, he was responsible for the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico.

When Castelar assumed leadership of the republic in 1873, Spain was at the height of disturbance and turmoil. He strengthened the army and resolutely undertook to crush rebellion. He also embarked on a policy of conciliation with the Roman Catholic church. His tactful and statesmanlike stance prevented rupture with the United States over the Virginius affair (October 31, 1873), in which U.S. seamen were executed as pirates by Spain during a Cuban insurrection.

Castelar was ousted from office by republican opposition to his conservative and conciliatory policies. A military coup followed, and he went into exile. After the accession of King Alfonso XII (1874–85), he returned and was elected to the Cortes. He became reconciled to the monarchy but continued to champion a unitary and conservative republic that would be established and run by legal and peaceful means.

Castelar authored many literary and journalistic writings, leaving behind more than 90 works, including novels, histories, and political speeches. He was considered one of the greatest orators of his time.
