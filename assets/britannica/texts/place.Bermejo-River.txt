Bermejo River,  western tributary of the Paraguay River, south-central South America. It rises near Tarija, Bolivia and, after a rapid plunge to the Chaco lowlands at the border with Argentina, receives the major tributaries Grande de Tarija and San Francisco. It then meanders southeastward in shifting channels past Embarcación, El Pintado, and Presidencia Roca to join the Paraguay River opposite Pilar, Paraguay. It extends some 650 miles (1,046 km). Much silt is carried in suspension by the river, thus originating its name (bermejo, “reddish colour”). The Bermejo forms the border between Formosa and Chaco provinces, Argentina. It is navigable for small craft along its central course, which is usually referred to as the Teuco River.
