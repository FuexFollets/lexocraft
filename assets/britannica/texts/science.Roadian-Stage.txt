Roadian Stage,  first of the three stages of the Middle Permian (Guadalupian) Series, made up of all rocks deposited during the Roadian Age (272.3 million to 268.8 million years ago) of the Permian Period.

In 2001 the International Commission on Stratigraphy established the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) defining the base of this interval within the limestone portion of the Cutoff Formation located in the Guadalupe Mountains of Texas, U.S. The GSSP coincides with the appearance of the conodont Jinogondolella nankingensis in the fossil record. Other important fossil organisms characteristic of the stage include ammonoids of the genera Demarezites and Waagenoceras.  Rocks of the Roadian Stage overlay those of the Kungurian Stage and sit below those of the Wordian Stage.
