Catharine Macaulay,  (born April 2, 1731, Wye, Kent, Eng.-died June 22, 1791, Binfield, near Windsor, Berkshire), British historian and radical political writer.

She was privately educated, and her readings in Greek and Roman history inculcated in her an enthusiasm for libertarian and republican ideals. Following her marriage to the Scottish physician George Macaulay in 1760, she began her History of England from the Accession of James I to That of the Brunswick Line, published in eight volumes between 1763 and 1783, in which she championed the Parliamentary cause, condemned Oliver Cromwell as a tyrant, and found her own republican ideals reflected in the parliamentarian John Hampden. The History was widely read in spite of the controversies generated by its clear republican sympathies.

Widowed in 1766, she moved in 1774 to Bath, where she attracted many admirers. In addition to espousing popular sovereignty and the moderate distribution of land in her works, Macaulay also took up the cause of the American colonists by attacking the Quebec Act and British colonial taxation in her Address to the People of England, Scotland and Ireland (1775). On a visit to Paris at the peak of her fame in 1777, she met Jacques Turgot and Benjamin Franklin; but her marriage the following year to William Graham, the 21-year-old brother of a quack physician, disgraced her in some circles. Nevertheless, on a trip to America in 1784â€“85, she and her husband were guests of George Washington at Mount Vernon. Her last political tract, Observations on the Reflections of The Right Hon. Edmund Burke on the Revolution in France (1790), defended the French Revolution, finding the unicameral National Assembly superior even to the American polity.
