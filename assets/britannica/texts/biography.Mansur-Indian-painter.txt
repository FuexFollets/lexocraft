Manṣūr (flourished 17th century, India) a leading member of the 17th-century Jahāngīr studio of Mughal painters, famed for his animal and bird studies. The emperor Jahāngīr honoured him with the title Nādir al-ʿAsr ("Wonder of the Age"), and in his memoirs Jahāngīr praises Manṣūr as "unique in his generation" in the art of drawing. Manṣūr was primarily a natural history painter who avoided personal expression in his careful studies.

Manṣūr made many studies of natural life under the direct orders of his patron, who was passionately fond of recording the rare specimens that were brought before him. A turkey cock painted about 1612 (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) is attributed to Manṣūr and marks that bird’s first appearance in India. Similarly, while on a trip to the Vale of Kashmir, Jahāngīr ordered Manṣūr to paint as many varieties of local flowers as possible, stating in his memoirs that the number depicted exceeded 100.
