Bābol,  city, northern Iran, on the Bābol River, about 15 miles (24 km) south of the Caspian Sea. Bābol gained importance during the reign (1797–1834) of Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh, though ʿAbbās I (died 1629) had laid out a pleasure garden and summer palace there. The city has paved streets, large and crowded bazaars, well-built houses, and small, handsome mosques and funeral towers. There are some manufacturing activities, but larger plants are at nearby Shāhī.

Meshed-e Sar, now called Bābol Sar, was formerly the port of Bābol on the Caspian, but it lost its function after the water level dropped. It is now a fashionable resort and has an airport. Pop. (2011) 219,467; (2016) 250,217.
