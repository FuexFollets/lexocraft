Jean Theodore Delacour,  (born Sept. 26, 1890, Paris, Fr.-died  Nov. 5, 1985, Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.), French-American aviculturist known for discovering and rearing some of the world’s rarest birds.

As a boy, Delacour collected more than 1,300 live birds, which were destroyed, along with the area they inhabited, during World War I. He later made expeditions to Asia, Africa, and South America and assembled a second collection, more than twice as large as the first, at the Château de Clères in Normandy. In the 1920s he brought the first live specimens of Edwards’ pheasants to England. In 1924 he brought a pair of unidentified dark blue pheasants from northern Vietnam, named them imperial pheasants, and later succeeded in breeding them in captivity. Many other new species and subspecies of birds and mammals were discovered and named by him.

In 1920 he founded an avicultural magazine called L’Oiseau (subsequently merged with Revue Française). Later he wrote his Oiseaux de l’Indochine Française (1931; "The Birds of French Indochina"), which became a standard work on the birds of that region.

During World War II, when the Germans again destroyed his aviary, Delacour left France for the United States. He became a U.S. citizen in 1946 but returned to Clères to reestablish the aviary and zoo, which was later donated to the French nation. He was director of the Los Angeles County Museum from 1951 to 1960.
