René-Just Haüy,  (born Feb. 28, 1743, Saint-Just-en-Chaussée, France-died  June 1, 1822, Paris), French mineralogist and one of the founders of the science of crystallography.

After studying theology, Haüy became an abbé and for 21 years served as professor at the Collège de Navarre. In 1802 he became professor of mineralogy at the Museum of Natural History in Paris, and in 1809 he was appointed to a similar post at the Sorbonne.

His interest in crystallography resulted, he later reported, from the accidental breaking of a piece of calcite. In examining the fragments he discovered that they cleaved along straight planes that met at constant angles. He broke more pieces of calcite and found that, regardless of the original shape, the broken fragments were consistently rhombohedral. From subsequent experiments he derived a thoroughgoing theory of crystal structure. Fundamental to his theory were the laws of decrement and of constancy of angles, whereby the cleavage forms of crystals were related geometrically to their primary forms or nuclei. Haüy subsequently applied his theory to the classification of minerals. He was also known for his studies of pyroelectricity and piezoelectricity in crystals. His publications include Traité de minéralogie (1801; "Treatise on Mineralogy"), Traité de physique ("Treatise on Physics"), written at Napoleon’s request (1803), and Tableau comparatif ("Comparative Table"), his mineralogical classification (1809).
