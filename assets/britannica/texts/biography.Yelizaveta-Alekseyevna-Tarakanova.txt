Yelizaveta Alekseyevna Tarakanova (born c. 1745—died Dec. 4 [Dec. 15, New Style], 1775, St. Petersburg, Russia) adventuress and pretender to the Russian throne who claimed to be the daughter of the unmarried empress Elizabeth (reigned 1741–62) and Count Aleksey G. Razumovsky.

She claimed to have been reared in St. Petersburg, but she was probably not Russian, and her origins and real name are unknown. She appeared in various cities of western Europe in the early 1770s and attracted several noble suitors. In 1774 she was convinced by émigré Polish rebels to pretend to the Russian throne. She thereupon claimed that she was Elizabeth’s daughter and also that she was the sister of Y.I. Pugachov (who was then leading a rebellion in southeastern Russia), much to the disquiet of the reigning Russian empress, Catherine II the Great.

Catherine’s erstwhile supporter, Aleksey Grigoryevich Orlov, discovered Tarakanova in Livorno, seduced her, and lured her aboard his ship in the harbour on the promise of marriage. Once aboard Tarakanova was arrested and sent to St. Petersburg, where she was imprisoned by Catherine in the Peter and Paul Fortress. She died there without revealing the secret of her past.
