Nevil Shute (born January 17, 1899, Ealing, Middlesex, England-died January 12, 1960, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) English-born novelist who showed a special talent for weaving his technical knowledge of engineering into the texture of his fictional narrative. His most famous work, On the Beach (1957), which he wrote while living in Australia, reflected his pessimism for humanity in the atomic age.

Shute was educated at Shrewsbury, served in the British army late in World War I, and then completed his education at the University of Oxford. He became an aeronautical engineer, a job he combined with his career as a novelist until the late 1930s. Following World War II, he left England and settled in Australia with his wife and daughters.

Marazan (1926) was the first of 25 books Shute wrote in a career that spanned 30 years. His major works include So Disdained (1928) and What Happened to the Corbetts (1939), a foretaste of World War IIâ€™s bombing of civilians. His later novels-all set in Australia-reflected a growing feeling of despair about the future. A Town Like Alice (1950) dealt with the Pacific theatre of World War II.

In On the Beach Shute describes the effect of an atomic war and vividly pictures the complete destruction of humanity. It was adapted as a 1959 film of the same title directed by Stanley Kramer and starring Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner.
