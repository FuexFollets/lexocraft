Rhaetian Stage,  uppermost of the three divisions of the Upper Triassic Series, representing those rocks deposited worldwide during Rhaetian time (208.5 million to 201.3 million years ago) in the Triassic Period. The stage name is derived from the Rhaetian Alps of Italy, Switzerland, and Austria; the stratotype is the KÃ¶ssen beds at Kendelbachgraben, Sankt Wolfgang, Austria. Rhaetian rocks are transitional in age and sometimes placed in the Lower Jurassic. In Great Britain the Rhaetian (or Rhaetic) consists of lagoonal deposits, such as limestones, shales, and marls, as well as bone beds that contain fragments of amphibians and reptiles. Elsewhere Rhaetian marine strata are correlated worldwide by two distinct ammonoid cephalopod biozones, both of which have designated type localities in North America. Rhaetian rocks may also consist of shelf limestones with characteristic brachiopods, conodonts, and other shelly forms. The Rhaetian Stage underlies the Hettangian Stage of the Lower Jurassic Series and overlies the Norian Stage of the Upper Triassic Series.
