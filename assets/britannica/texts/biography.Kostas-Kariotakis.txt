Kóstas Kariotákis (born 1896, Trípolis, Greece-died  July 20, 1928, Préveza) Greek poet influenced by the 19th-century French Symbolist poets.

Kariotákis spent much of his lonely childhood in Crete. He read law at Athens and won a prize for poetry in 1920. After obtaining his degree he worked as a government clerk in Athens, where he developed a friendship with the young poet Maria Polidoúri. Later he was transferred to Pátrai and thence to Préveza, where he shot himself.

Kariotákis’ three volumes of poetry show the influence of the New School of Poetry of Athens, founded in about 1880 by Kostís Palamás, which revolted against Katharevusa, the stilted and archaic official language of Greece, and against the emotionalism of the Romantics. His poetry also reveals the Symbolist influence in addition to the loneliness and despair of his childhood.
