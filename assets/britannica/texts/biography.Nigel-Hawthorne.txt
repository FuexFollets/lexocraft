Nigel Hawthorne (born April 5, 1929, Coventry, West Midlands, England-died December 26, 2001, Baldock, Hertfordshire) British actor, perhaps best known for his portrayal of the cunning, manipulative civil servant Sir Humphrey Appleby in the British television series Yes, Minister (1980–83, 1985–86) and Yes, Prime Minister (1986–87).

When Hawthorne was four years old, his family moved to Cape Town, South Africa. There he had a lonely childhood and was often at odds with his domineering father, who dissuaded him from pursuing a career in acting. Hawthorne attended the University of Cape Town, and, despite his father’s opposition, he made his professional stage debut in a 1950 production of The Shop at Sly Corner. The following year he moved to England and appeared on the London stage in You Can’t Take It with You. He had little other success, however, and soon moved back to South Africa, where he performed a number of leading roles. In 1961 he toured in Beyond the Fringe, and the next year he returned to London, where he made his West End debut in Talking to You, and toured as Field Marshal Haig in Oh! What a Lovely War.

In 1977 Hawthorne played Major Flack in the play Privates on Parade, which led to his being cast as Sir Humphrey Appleby, the quintessential civil servant, in the satiric BBC series Yes, Minister and its sequel, Yes, Prime Minister. Hawthorne had been acting for some 30 years before taking the role, which brought him his first real fame as well as four British Academy Television Awards (TV BAFTAs). He went on to stage triumphs in Shadowlands in London (1989) and on Broadway (1990), where he won a Tony Award. He starred in the title role of The Madness of George III (1991) in London, for which he won an Olivier Award. He later starred in the film adaptation, The Madness of King George (1994), and received an Academy Award nomination for the role. Hawthorne was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1987 and was knighted in 1999. Also in 1999 came his final stage role, the title character in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s King Lear. His autobiography, Straight Face, was published posthumously in 2002.
