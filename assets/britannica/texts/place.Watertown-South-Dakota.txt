Watertown,  city, seat (1878) of Codington county, eastern South Dakota, U.S. It lies on the Big Sioux River, between Lakes Kampeska and Pelican, about 95 miles (155 km) north of Sioux Falls. It was laid out in 1878 following the extension of the Winona and St. Peter Railroad (now part of the Union Pacific Railroad Company) and was named for Watertown, New York. An earlier settlement, called Kampeska City, was abandoned in 1874 after grasshoppers destroyed the crops. The economy of Watertown is based largely on the manufacturing of high-technology electronic and magnetic components. Other manufactures include construction equipment and parts, rubber products, signs, welding equipment, and hydraulic and mechanical tubes. Turkey processing is also important. Area agriculture produces dairy products, cattle, poultry, soybeans, corn (maize), wheat, oats, and rye. Tourism, mostly in the form of outdoor recreation on area waterways, contributes to the economy. A casino operated by the Sioux is just north of the city. Watertown is the seat of Lake Area Technical Institute (1965). Local attractions include Mellette House (1883), the home of Arthur Calvin Mellette, the last governor of Dakota Territory and the first governor of South Dakota; the Codington County Heritage Museum, which preserves local history; the Terry Redlin Art Center, which displays original paintings of local artist Terry Redlin and has a planetarium; and the Bramble Park Zoo. Nearby are Sandy Shore and Pelican Lake recreation areas. Inc. 1885. Pop. (2000) 20,237; (2010) 21,482.
