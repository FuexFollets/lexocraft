Dorothy Whipple,  (born February 26, 1893, Blackburn, Lancashire, England-died September 14, 1966, Blackburn), English novelist and short-story writer whose works, set largely in the north of England, excavate the everyday experiences of middle-class households of her era.

She grew up in Blackburn as one of eight children of Walter Stirrup, a local architect, and his wife, Ada. In 1917 she married an educational administrator, Henry Whipple, who was more than two decades older; they later settled in Nottingham. After the first decade of her marriage, Whipple embarked on a serious literary career that saw the publication of nine novels, the first of which was Young Anne (1927) and which also included High Wages (1930), Greenbanks (1932), and The Priory (1939). Two of her novels (They Knew Mr. Knight [1934] and They Were Sisters [1943]) were adapted for film in the 1940s. She also published three collections of short stories-selections from which appear in The Closed Door, and Other Stories (2007)-as well as two autobiographical works and several childrenâ€™s books. Someone at a Distance (1953) was her last novel, and her popularity declined thereafter. Although sometimes reprinted in following decades, her work received renewed attention at the turn of the 21st century.
