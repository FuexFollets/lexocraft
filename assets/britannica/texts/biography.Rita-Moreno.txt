Rita Moreno (born December 11, 1931, Humacao, Puerto Rico) Puerto Rican-born American actress, dancer, and singer who accomplished the rare feat of winning the four major North American entertainment awards (EGOT): Emmy (1977, 1978), Grammy (1972), Oscar (1962), and Tony (1975). She was also the first Hispanic woman to receive an Oscar (Academy Award).

After her parents divorced, Alverio moved (1935) to New York City with her mother, who eventually remarried. She later began using her stepfather’s surname, Moreno. As a youth, she took dance lessons, and she later dubbed voices for American child stars in films released to Spanish-speaking countries. In 1945, at age 13, she made her Broadway debut in Skydrift. Her first big-screen appearance was in So Young, So Bad (1950). She was credited as Rosita Moreno, but soon thereafter she took the first name Rita.

Although Moreno subsequently appeared in several notable films—including the musicals Singin’ in the Rain (1952) and The King and I (1956), playing a starlet and a slave, respectively—her early career was hampered by studios wanting to cast her in stereotypical ethnic roles or as a sexpot. Partly because of professional frustrations—though largely because of a tumultuous relationship with Marlon Brando—she attempted suicide in 1961. That year, however, Moreno received critical acclaim as the fiery and cynical Anita in West Side Story. For her performance—which highlighted her energetic dancing—Moreno won an Academy Award for best supporting actress. (Although she was a singer, her singing voice was dubbed in the movie.) The musical drama was named best picture. Despite the success, Moreno continued to struggle for good roles, and her film work was limited. Later movies included Summer and Smoke (1961), Carnal Knowledge (1971), and Slums of Beverly Hills (1998). In 2021 she appeared in Steven Spielberg’s acclaimed remake of West Side Story, and two years later she joined an all-star cast—that included Jane Fonda, Sally Field, and Lily Tomlin—in 80 for Brady, a comedy about a group of friends whose love for the New England Patriots and star quarterback Tom Brady leads to a raucous Super Bowl weekend.

In 1964 Moreno returned to Broadway, appearing in The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window. She continued to occasionally perform on the stage, and in 1975 she won a Tony for her portrayal of Googie Gomez in The Ritz. She reprised the comedic role for the 1976 film adaptation. Her other notable stage work included The Odd Couple (1985–86), a revival of the Neil Simon play but featuring female leads. In 2011 she starred in the critically acclaimed Rita Moreno: Life Without Makeup, which was staged in California and showcased her irrepressible nature.

Moreno also frequently appeared on television. From 1971 to 1977 she starred in the children’s educational series The Electric Company, where she became noted for the catchphrase “Hey, you guys!” In 1972 she received a Grammy for her work on the show’s album. An appearance on The Muppet Show earned her an Emmy in 1977, and with that award she became the second woman and third person to win an EGOT; earlier that year Helen Hayes had accomplished the feat. In 1978 Moreno claimed her second Emmy, for her work on The Rockford Files. She later appeared as a nun/counselor in the prison drama Oz (1997–2003), and she had guest roles in numerous series, including The Golden Girls, Miami Vice, Murphy Brown, and Ugly Betty. Moreno also provided the voice of the title character in the PBS series Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego? She later appeared as the matriarch of a Cuban American family in One Day at a Time (2017–20), a remake of Norman Lear’s 1970s sitcom of the same name; the series originally aired on Netflix, but after three seasons it moved to Pop TV for a short run.

Moreno’s other notable awards included the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2004), and in 2015 she was named a recipient of a Kennedy Center Honor. She published an eponymous memoir in 2013. Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go for It (2021) is a documentary about her life and career.
