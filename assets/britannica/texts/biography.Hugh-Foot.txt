Hugh Foot (born Oct. 8, 1907, Plymouth, Devon, Eng.—died  Sept. 5, 1990, near Plymouth) was a British diplomat who led British colonies to their independence.

Foot was the son of a Liberal member of Parliament, and his three brothers were also elected to Parliament. After attending the University of Cambridge (B.A., 1929) Foot entered the civil administrative service. After postings in Palestine (1929–37) and Transjordan (1939–43), he joined the army as a lieutenant colonel in charge of the military administration of Cyrenaica (1943). He then served as colonial secretary of Cyprus (1943–45) and colonial secretary and governor of Jamaica (1945–47). As chief secretary of Nigeria (1947–50) he was a steadying presence while the idea of independence grew.

Foot returned to Jamaica in 1951 and stayed until 1957 as captain general and governor in chief. As governor and commander in chief of Cyprus (1957–60) he encouraged agreement between warring Greek and Turkish factions and planned for peaceable independent rule, which Cyprus achieved in 1960. As Britain’s representative to the United Nations (1961–62), Foot became principal adviser on emerging countries, but resigned (1962) in protest against Britain’s Rhodesian policy. In 1964, the year he was made a life peer, he was appointed a permanent United Kingdom representative to the UN; he served until 1970. His autobiography A Start in Freedom was published in 1964.
