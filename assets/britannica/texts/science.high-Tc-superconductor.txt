…ceramic conductors are the so-called high Tc superconductors, materials that lose their resistance at much higher critical temperatures than their metal alloy counterparts. Most high Tc ceramics are layered structures, with two-dimensional copper-oxygen sheets along which superconduction takes place. The first of these was discovered in 1986 by the Swiss…
