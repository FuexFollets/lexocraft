António, prior of Crato (born 1531, Lisbon—died  Aug. 26, 1595, Paris) ecclesiastic and claimant to the throne of Portugal who never gained the crown despite armed assistance from France and England.

António was the illegitimate son of Luís, duke of Beja, brother of King John III of Portugal. He became head of the Order of St. John in Portugal and was endowed (1555) with the wealthy priory of Crato. He accompanied King Sebastian (reigned 1557–78), John III’s grandson, to North Africa, where, in the Battle of the Three Kings (1578), Sebastian was killed and António captured. On his return to Portugal, António’s claim to the throne was rejected by Sebastian’s successor Henry, the last surviving brother of John III, and later by the council that governed Portugal for some months after Henry’s death (January 1580). In June 1580 he was acclaimed king as António I at Santarém by his supporters. His possession of the crown, however, was contested by Philip II of Spain, whose army, under the Duke of Alba, defeated António outside Lisbon two months later. The Spanish king then became Philip I of Portugal, and António sought refuge in Paris.

With French help, António sent two naval expeditions (1582 and 1583) to the Azores, where he was still recognized as king. Both of his forces were defeated by Spanish squadrons. He next went to England, where he enlisted the assistance of Elizabeth I. An English fleet under Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Norris effected a landing near Lisbon in support of António in 1589, but the expedition proved a costly failure. Impoverished and in ill health, António returned to Paris, where he planned further expeditions until his death.
