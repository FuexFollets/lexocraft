Joseph Kimhi,  (born c. 1105, Spain—died c. 1170, Narbonne?, Fr.), European grammarian, biblical exegete, and poet who, with his sons, Moses and David, made fundamental contributions to establishing Hebrew-language studies.

Through his many translations into Hebrew of works written in Arabic by Spanish Jews, Kimhi came to play a principal part in introducing Hebraic studies to the rest of Europe. His acquaintance with Latin grammar led him to divide the previously acknowledged seven Hebrew vowels into five long and five short vowels. His comprehensive grammatical text, Sefer ha-zikkaron (“Book of Remembrance”), introduced a classification of verb stems for Hebrew that remains in use. Another work, Sefer ha-galui (“Book of the Demonstration”), dealing with lexicography and questions of exegesis, served as a vehicle for criticizing the work of Jacob ben Meir Tam, the leading Talmudic scholar of the time. Among his critical commentaries on various books of the Old Testament, those on Proverbs and Job were published. Those that became lost are known, however, to have had important exegetic worth. Kimhi’s work on Jewish apologetics, Sefer ha-Berit (“Book of the Covenant”), is important for its historical information on the position of the Jews in Provence. He also established himself as a poet of considerable merit and was frequently quoted by later generations. His Shekel hakodesh (“The Holy Shekel”) was published with an English translation in 1919.
