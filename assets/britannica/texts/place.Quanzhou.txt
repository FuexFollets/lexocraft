Quanzhou,  port and city, eastern coastal Fujian sheng (province), China. It is situated on the north bank of the Jin River, at the head of the river’s estuary, facing the Taiwan Strait. Pop. (2002 est.) city, 497,723; (2007 est.) urban agglom., 1,463,000.

A Quanzhou prefecture was established there in 618 ce. The only sizable settlement in the present area was Nan’an county-some 12.5 miles (20 km) up the Xi River valley-which had been set up in the 6th century by the Nan (Southern) Chen regime (557–589). The present Quanzhou was founded in 700 as Wurongzhu; its name was changed to Quanzhou in 711, and it was established as a county seat; it was a convenient administrative centre for the scattered Chinese settlements in the area, under the name Jinjiang, in 718. The prefecture of Quanzhou was promoted to a superior prefecture under the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911/12) dynasties. After 1911, under the Chinese republic, the superior prefecture reverted to county status under its old name Jinjiang. In 1951, when Quanzhou was established as a city, all of Jinjiang county was merged into it. The Jinjiang county administration was moved and established on the south bank of the Pujiang River, though it was later named Jinjiang city within the Quanzhou urban area.

During the later Tang period (618–907), Quanzhou began to develop into a major seaport and a centre of foreign trade, rivaling Guangzhou (Canton) and Hanoi, Viet. Many Persians and Arabs settled there. During the 10th century, first under the independent Fujianese kingdom of Min (909–945), then under local warlords (944–960), and finally under the reunified empire of Song (960–1279), Quanzhou remained a centre of both foreign trade and the manufacture of oceangoing ships, which gradually enabled Chinese from Fujian to replace Arabs as chief carriers in the trade with the Middle East. Between 742 and 1162 Quanzhou’s population increased more than tenfold, and it soon outstripped Guangzhou in volume of trade. By the 13th century Quanzhou was said to have 500,000 inhabitants, including numerous Arabs, who had their own merchant quarter on the waterfront. Under the Yuan (Mongol) dynasty (1279–1368), it was China’s greatest port and was renowned throughout the world, being known to the 13th-century Venetian traveler Marco Polo and to the 14th-century Muslim traveler Ibn Baṭṭūṭah as Zaytūn-a rendering of the common name for the city, Citongcheng.

After the beginning of the 15th century, however, when the Chinese withdrew from long-range trade and when the attacks of Japanese pirates put the Ming leadership on the defensive, Quanzhou was deeply affected. At the same time, the harbour began to silt up, and in the 17th century Fuzhou and, more particularly, the nearby port of Xiamen (Amoy) began to rival it in both coastal and foreign trade. It gradually declined into a secondary coastal port, most of whose commerce was with Taiwan. Many people from this area emigrated to Taiwan, elsewhere in Southeast Asia, or overseas. Quanzhou to a large extent became economically dependent on Xiamen. Its role receded still further when Xiamen’s rail link with the interior was completed in 1956.

The city is now a regional market and commercial centre-a collection point for local agricultural products, such as sugarcane, jute, fruit, and peanuts (groundnuts), and a distribution centre for manufactures imported through Xiamen. There is some small-scale industry, including the manufacture of porcelain, farm implements, and fertilizer, and food processing, such as sugar refining, flour milling, and oil extraction. Since the 1980s Quanzhou has attracted many investors from the overseas Chinese and Taiwanese communities, and the city has experienced rapid economic development. The city is now linked with Xiamen by rail through Zhangping and via an express highway that provides quicker access to the major cities in the province. Its airport at Jinjiang has regular flights to major cities on the mainland as well as to Hong Kong.

Quanzhou retains many relics of its medieval prosperity, including a large number of stone structures and statuary; notable is an 11th-century stone bridge that spans the Jin River. Twin stone pagodas (1228–38) follow the design of wooden ones first built in 865 and 916; a large statue of a Daoist saint dates to the Song period. An ancient mosque and the tombs of early Muslim missionaries also are preserved. A wooden ship, dating from the 12th or 13th century and excavated in 1974, occupies a special exhibition hall in the city. Tourism has become important to the local economy.
