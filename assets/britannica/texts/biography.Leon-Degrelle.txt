Léon Degrelle,  (born June 15, 1906, Bouillon, Belg.—died  March 31, 1994, Málaga, Spain), founder and leader of the Rexist Party of Belgium, who collaborated with the Germans during World War II.

After failing three times to pass his final law exams at the Catholic University of Leuven (Louvain), Degrelle, who was a dynamic orator, entered politics. Using banking scandals and the corruption of national parties as issues, he organized the Rexist Movement in 1930, allegedly to cleanse the Roman Catholic religion of political contamination. Though originally a wing of the ruling Catholic Party, the Rexist Movement became an opposition party and, under Degrelle’s guidance, elected 21 deputies to the Belgian Parliament in 1936. Subsidized by the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, Degrelle turned the Rexists into a fascist organization. In alliance with the 16 deputies of the separatist Flemish Nationalist Party, the Rexists forced the formation of weak coalition governments in the late 1930s.

During World War II Degrelle collaborated with the German occupation forces. In August 1941 he formed and later commanded the Walloon and Flemish storm-trooper brigades that fought on the Russian front. Under his guidance the Rexists took control of local governments and newspapers in Belgium. After Belgium was liberated (September 1944) he was sentenced in absentia to death as a collaborator. Degrelle flew to Spain in the last days of the war after fighting the Soviet advance into eastern Germany. In Spain he was protected by Francisco Franco and became a Spanish citizen.
