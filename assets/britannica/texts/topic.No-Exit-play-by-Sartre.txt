No Exit,  one-act philosophical drama by Jean-Paul Sartre, performed in 1944 and published in 1945. Its original, French title, Huis clos, is sometimes also translated as In Camera or Dead End. The play proposes that “hell is other people” rather than a state created by God.

The play begins with a bellman ushering three recently deceased people into a room. They are Garcin, a revolutionary who betrayed his own cause and wants to be reassured that he is not a coward; Estelle, a nymphomaniac who has killed her illegitimate child; and Inez, a predatory lesbian. All the characters require another person for self-definition, yet each is most attracted to the person most likely to discomfit. Their inability to escape from each other guarantees their eternal torture.
