ozonolysis,  a reaction used in organic chemistry to determine the position of a carbon-carbon double bond in unsaturated compounds. It involves the reaction of the compound with ozone leading to the formation of an ozonide, and the ozonide yields on hydrogenation or treatment with acid a mixture containing aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids. From the determination of the structure of the aldehydes and ketones so produced, it is possible to determine the position of the double bond in the original unsaturated compound.

Ozonolysis has been used very extensively in the determination of the structure of natural products, particularly the terpenes. It has also been used in the study of the structure of aromatic compounds and for the synthesis of rare aldehydes and ketones. Thus, oleic acid on ozonolysis yields n-nonanal (pelargonic aldehyde) and azelaic semialdehyde.
