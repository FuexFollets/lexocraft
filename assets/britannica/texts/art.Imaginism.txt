Imaginism,  Russian poetic movement that followed the Russian Revolution of 1917 and advocated poetry based on a series of arresting and unusual images. It is sometimes called Imagism but is unrelated to the 20th-century Anglo-American movement of that name.

The main poets of Imaginism were Vadim Shershenevich and Ryurik Ivnev (pseudonym of Mikhail Aleksandrovich Kovalyov), both former Futurists; Sergey Yesenin, who, after the revolution, was on his way to gaining wider fame; and Anatoly Mariengof, a young provincial. In January 1919 they signed a manifesto, the text of which had been written primarily by Shershenevich.

Imaginism flourished between 1919 and 1922, when the group published some 60 books of poetry and theoretical tracts and owned a publishing house and a magazine. Imaginist poets read at cafés and on stages and drew public attention for the atmosphere of literary scandal they created as well as for their outstanding poetic talent. By 1922, however, Yesenin, the most talented of the Imaginists, began to change his poetics, and in 1924 he announced his withdrawal from the group. Subsequently Imaginism’s popularity declined markedly,  although some avant-garde poets of the second half of the 20th century used their methods.
