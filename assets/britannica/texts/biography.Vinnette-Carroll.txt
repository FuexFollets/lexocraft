Vinnette Carroll,  (born March 11, 1922, New York, New York, U.S.-died November 5, 2002, Lauderhill, Florida), American playwright, stage director, and actress, the first African American woman to direct on Broadway.

Carroll attended Long Island University (B.A., 1944) and New York University (M.A., 1946). Although she was educated in psychology and for a time worked as a clinical psychologist, she left the field to study for the theatre. She appeared in several student productions at the New School for Social Research (now New School University) and made her professional debut in 1948. She first appeared on Broadway in 1957. In 1962 she won an Obie Award for her role in Errol John’s Moon on a Rainbow Shawl. A strong proponent of arts education, she founded in 1967 the Urban Arts Corps (renamed the Urban Arts Theater in 1980) to foster participation by minority groups in all aspects of the theatrical arts.

She based her first play, Trumpets of the Lord (1963), a musical revue, on the work of poet James Weldon Johnson. The hit gospel revue Don’t Bother Me, I Can’t Cope, conceived by Carroll and with music and lyrics by Micki Grant, opened on Broadway in 1972 with Carroll as director and was nominated for four Tony Awards. Her adaptation of The Gospel According to Matthew, Your Arms Too Short to Box with God (also in collaboration with Grant), opened on Broadway in 1976 and was nominated for four Tonys. As an actress, Carroll appeared in Up the Down Staircase (1967), Alice’s Restaurant (1969), and other films. She also worked in television, and in 1964 she received an Emmy Award for Beyond the Blues.
