Victory Peak,  mountain in the eastern Kakshaal (Kokshaal-Tau) Range of the Tien Shan, on the frontier of Kyrgyzstan and China. It was first identified in 1943 as the tallest peak (24,406 feet [7,439 metres]) in the Tien Shan range and the second highest peak in what was then the Soviet Union; it is now the highest peak in Kyrgyzstan. Its name commemorates the Allied victory in World War II. An enormous dome-shaped mountain, heavily glaciated and frequently wreathed in clouds, it was first climbed in 1956 by Soviet alpinists.
