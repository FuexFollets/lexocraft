Kristin Hunter Lattany (born September 12, 1931, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died November 14, 2008, Magnolia, New Jersey) was an American novelist who examined black life and race relations in the United States in both children’s stories and works for adults.

Lattany began writing for The Pittsburgh Courier, an important African American newspaper, when she was 14 and continued until the year after she graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1951 with a bachelor’s degree in elementary education. She married writer Joseph Hunter in 1952 (divorced 1962). After briefly working as a teacher, she became an advertising copywriter. During that time, she won a national television contest in 1955 with her script Minority of One, about school integration; fearing controversy, the network rewrote the story to show a French-speaking immigrant entering an all-white school.

In her first and best-known novel, God Bless the Child (1964), three generations of women confront choices forced upon them by their skin tones. Despite harshly realistic settings, her subsequent fiction tended toward optimism. The Landlord (1966; film 1970) presents a misanthropic white landlord transformed by his new black tenants. After her second marriage in 1968, she published variously as Kristin Hunter, Kristin Hunter Lattany, and Kristin Lattany. In The Survivors (1975), a lonely, prosperous, middle-aged dressmaker befriends a neglected 13-year-old boy despite his involvement with dishonest and sometimes brutal acquaintances. The comical Kinfolks (1996) concerns the revelation that the engaged children of two lifelong friends were produced by unions with the same man. Do Unto Others (2000) investigates the cultural differences between African Americans and recent African immigrants through the story of a hair salon owner who shelters a young Nigerian woman. Lattany delved into campus race relations in Breaking Away (2003), which centres on a black professor who is drawn into a harassment lawsuit initiated by a group of students.

Her first book for young readers, The Soul Brothers and Sister Lou (1968), is about a musical group inspired by the youths who sang together nightly in the alley below her apartment. Its sequel was Lou in the Limelight (1981). Lattany also wrote the young adult collections Boss Cat (1971) and Guests in the Promised Land (1973).

Lattany taught in the English department at the University of Pennsylvania from 1972 to 1995.
