National Audubon Society,  U.S. organization dedicated to conserving and restoring natural ecosystems. Founded in 1905 and named for John James Audubon, the society has 600,000 members and maintains more than 100 wildlife sanctuaries and nature centres throughout the United States. Its high-priority campaigns include preserving wetlands and endangered forests, protecting corridors for migratory birds, and conserving marine wildlife. Its 300-member staff includes scientists, educators, sanctuary managers, and government affairs specialists.

Because of John James Audubon’s personal history as an enslaver, white supremacist, and critic of emancipation, several regional chapters of the organization chose to drop Audubon from their name in 2023 in an attempt to encourage the national organization to do the same. Despite such actions, the national organization decided to retain its current name, citing that the value of the organization’s work “transcends one person’s name” and that the word Audubon had risen to become a symbol for the organization’s well-known conservation mission.
