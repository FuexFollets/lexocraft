Stanisław Mikołajczyk (born July 18, 1901, Holsterhausen, now in North Rhine–Westphalia, Ger.-died  Dec. 13, 1966, Washington, D.C.) Polish statesman, who tried to establish a democratic, non-Soviet regime in Poland after World War II.

Coorganizer and leader of the Peasant Party (1931–39) and a member of the Sejm (Diet), Mikołajczyk fled to London after the German invasion of Poland in 1939. He served as minister of the interior of the Polish government in exile and then became deputy prime minister (1941–43) and prime minister (1943–44).

On June 27, 1945, Mikołajczyk returned to Poland and joined the Communist-dominated provisional government as second deputy premier and minister of agriculture and land reform. At the Potsdam Conference, he tried to press the interests of a free Poland, a condition that was agreed upon but ignored. Mikołajczyk’s Peasant Party leaders, as the only organized non-Communist opposition, suffered from repeated intimidation and arrests. When the manipulated election of 1947 foreshadowed a Stalinist takeover, Mikołajczyk fled to England and then to the United States.

Mikołajczyk was the author of The Pattern of Soviet Domination (1948). In 2000 the ashes of Mikołajczyk and his wife were brought to Poland for burial in the city of Poznań.
