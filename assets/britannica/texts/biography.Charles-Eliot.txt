Sir Charles Eliot (born Jan. 8, 1862, Sibford Gower, Oxfordshire, Eng.—died  March 16, 1931, at sea, in the Strait of Malacca) diplomat and colonial administrator who initiated the policy of white supremacy in the British East Africa Protectorate (now Kenya).

A scholar and linguist, Eliot served in diplomatic posts in Russia (1885), Morocco (1892), Turkey (1893), and Washington, D.C. (1899). In 1900 he was knighted and appointed commissioner and consul general for the East Africa Protectorate. He collaborated with the farmers there (notably Lord Delamere, to whom he ceded 100,000 acres [40,500 hectares] of land) and encouraged European immigration by the wholesale award of land concessions to European settlers.

By 1903 he was encountering opposition from the Colonial Office, which felt he was proceeding too rapidly. In 1904, after being criticized for granting a concession on land previously reserved for the indigenous Maasai people, he resigned his position. Following his resignation, he served as vice chancellor of both the University of Sheffield (1905–12) and the University of Hong Kong (1912–18). His last diplomatic post was as the British ambassador to Japan, which he began in 1920. He retired in 1926, continuing to live in Japan. During his life he wrote several papers and books, including The East Africa Protectorate (1905) and Letters from the Far East (1907).
