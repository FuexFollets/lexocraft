Brigadier Gerard,   (foaled 1968), English racehorse (Thoroughbred) who won all but one of his 18 races in his three-year racing career, winning more than $581,000. He was sired by Queenâ€™s Hussar and foaled by La Paiva. John Hislop bred him, his wife owned him, and Major Dick Hern trained him at West Ilsley in Berkshire. In 1970 he entered four races and won them all. The following year he was again unbeaten, this time in six races, most notably the Two Thousand Guineas. In 1972, his last year of racing, he came in first in seven contests, losing only to the American-bred Roberto. Retired from racing after the 1972 season, Brigadier Gerard was sent to stud.
