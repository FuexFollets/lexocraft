Lord Emsworth,  fictional character, the elderly absentminded ninth proprietor of Blandings Castle, Shropshire, Eng., the setting of many short stories and novels by P.G. Wodehouse-from Something Fresh (1915) to his final, unfinished Sunset at Blandings (1977). Lord Emsworth is almost invariably called upon to save the day (to rescue his dim-witted son Freddie, to thwart pig thieves, to enable young lovers to achieve wedded bliss), and he is frequently harassed by his snobbish sisters. His only desire is to be left in peace amid the perpetually summery castle gardens to devote himself to his prize pig, Empress of Blandings.
